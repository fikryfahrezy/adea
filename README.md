## Loan Origination System Overview

## Definition

### Loan Origination

Loan origination is the process by which a borrower applies for a new loan, and a lender processes that application. Origination generally includes all the steps from taking a loan application up to disbursal of funds (or declining the application). For mortgages, there is a specific mortgage origination process. Loan servicing covers everything after disbursing the funds until the loan is fully paid off. Loan origination is a specialized version of new account opening for financial services organizations. Certain people and organizations specialize in loan origination. Mortgage brokers and other mortgage originator companies serve as a prominent example [ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan_origination)

### Loan Appraisal Compliance

_There is no concrete definition of it I can find, but based on many sources I read the definition is self-explanatory by its name, so the loan application borrower sent will be reviewed by ***something*** before it gets approval._

### Loan Appraisal Approval

The definition is self-explanatory by its name, it means reviewed loan applicant will be approved or rejected based on loan appraisal compliance\_

### Customer On-Boarding

Client onboarding can be simply defined as the entire process through which a user starts his journey as a customer or a client of a bank/ financial institution. Similarly, the onboarding experience can be defined as the relationship between the customer and the organization. [ref](https://www.digipay.guru/blog/future-of-customer-onboarding-in-banks/)
